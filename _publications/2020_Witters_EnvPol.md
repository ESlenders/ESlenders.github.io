<h2> Abstract </h2>
<p align= "justify">
Image scanning microscopy is a technique of confocal microscopy in which the confocal pinhole is replaced by a detector array, and the image is reconstructed most straightforwardly by pixel reassignment. In the fluorescence mode, the detector array collects most of the fluorescent light, so the signal-to-noise ratio is much improved compared with confocal microscopy with a small pinhole, while the resolution is improved compared with conventional fluorescence microscopy. Here we consider two cases in which the illumination and detection point spread functions are dissimilar: illumination with a Bessel beam and multiphoton microscopy. It has been shown previously that for Bessel beam illumination in image scanning microscopy with a large array, the imaging performance is degraded. On the other hand, it is also known that the resolution of confocal microscopy is improved by Bessel beam illumination. Here...
