<h2> Abstract </h2>
<p align= "justify">
We discuss the properties of signal strength and integrated intensity in two-photon excitation confocal microscopy and image scanning microscopy. The resolution, optical sectioning and background rejection are all improved over nonconfocal two-photon microscopy. Replacing the pinhole of confocal two-photon microscopy with a detector array increases the peak intensity of the point spread function. The outer pixels of a detector array give signals from defocused regions, and thus the processing of these, such as through subtraction, can further improve optical sectioning and background rejection.
