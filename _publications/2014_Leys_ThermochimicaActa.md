<h2> Abstract </h2>
<p align= "justify">
Simultaneously measured high-resolution enthalpy and heat capacity data are obtained by means of a novel type Peltier-element-based adiabatic scanning calorimeter that can also operate as a classical adiabatic heat-step calorimeter. Specific enthalpy and specific heat capacity results with 2% uncertainty and sub-mK temperature resolution are presented for the melting transition of the calorimetric reference materials biphenyl and phenyl salicylate. The simultaneously obtained enthalpy and heat capacity data allow for a simplified and reliable purity analysis.
