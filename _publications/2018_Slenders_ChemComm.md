<h2> Abstract </h2>
<p align= "justify">
The lipid organization of microbubbles is important in many applications. By monitoring the photoselection and emission spectrum of the fluorescent probe Laurdan in perfluorobutane gas-filled DPPC microbubbles with a two-photon laser scanning microscope, we observed a transition to a more rigid lipid organization in 30 minutes to several hours.
