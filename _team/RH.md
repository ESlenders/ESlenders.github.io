By training, I am a Particle Physicist that fell in love with Biological Physics shortly after graduating. I did my PhD in both the [Musa Mhlanga](http://mhlangalab.org/) and [Christophe Zimmer](https://research.pasteur.fr/en/team/imaging-and-modeling/) laboratories, carrying out research between [IMM](https://imm.medicina.ulisboa.pt/) (Portugal), [Institut Pasteur](https://www.pasteur.fr/en) (France), [CSIR](https://www.csir.co.za/) (South Africa) and [Andor Technology](https://andor.oxinst.com/) (UK and USA). During this time, I entered the field of Super-Resolution Microscopy, developing technologies that enable imaging of cellular and viral structures at unprecedented resolution. During my PhD and postdoc, I applied the methods I developed to study Cell Signalling, T-cell Immunology and Viral Infection. In 2013 I established my first research group at UCL, with a dual emphasis on Developing new Imaging Technologies and Cell Biology research. In 2017 I was further invited to extend my group into the Francis Crick Institute, where I established a second small laboratory. In 2019 I was promoted to full Professor at UCL. My technological developments are widely disseminated to the Cell Biology and Biomedical research community. My algorithms QuickPALM, NanoJ, SRRF and SQUIRREL are among the most used and cited analytical methods in the Super-Resolution Microscopy field. My core philosophy has been to make my research reproducible, transparent and open-source.
