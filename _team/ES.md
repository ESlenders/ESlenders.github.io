<h2>ShortBio</h2>
Eli Slenders studied physics at Hasselt University (Hasselt, Belgium) and at KU Leuven (Leuven, Belgium). He graduated in 2013. From 2014 to 2018, he worked as a PhD student at Hasselt University in the Biophysics group of prof. M. Ameloot. His PhD thesis was entitled “Resolution in coherent and incoherent optical imaging with two-photon excitation microscopy”. Since 2019, Eli is a post-doctoral researcher under the supervision of Giuseppe Vicidomini in the Molecular Microscopy and Spectroscopy research line at the Italian Institute of Technology (IIT, Genoa, Italy). His research interests include the theoretical design and experimental validation of optical microscopy tools such as multiphoton image scanning microscopy and fluorescence correlation spectroscopy.
