<h2>ShortBio</h2>
Eli Slenders has a bachelor's and master's degree in physics from Hasselt University (Hasselt, Belgium) and KU Leuven (Leuven, Belgium), respectively. He graduated in 2013. From 2014 to 2018, he worked as a PhD student at Hasselt University in the Biophysics group of prof. M. Ameloot. His PhD thesis was entitled “Resolution in coherent and incoherent optical imaging with two-photon excitation microscopy”. In 2019, Eli joined the Molecular Microscopy and Spectroscopy research line at the Italian Institute of Technology (IIT, Genoa, Italy) under the supervision of Giuseppe Vicidomini, first as a postdoc, since 2021 as a Marie Skłodowska-Curie Actions research fellow. His research interests include the theoretical design and experimental validation of optical microscopy tools such as multiphoton image scanning microscopy, fluorescence correlation spectroscopy, and super-resolution microscopy.
