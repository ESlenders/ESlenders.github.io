<h2>ShortBio</h2>
I am interested in developing and applying advanced microscopy techniques to decipher functional and structural organisation of life at multiple scales. For this, I develop analytical and optical tools. You can find me on Twitter (@LaineBioImaging), in the optics lab tinkering with microscopes or on my computer developing image analyses. </p>

<h2>Project Description</h2>
French but I have been living in the UK for long enough to have forgotten how real buttery pastries taste like. I did my PhD at Imperial College in biophotonics (throwing lasers and microscopes at cells and molecules !), then moved to Cambridge for PostDoc to develop super-resolution microscopy (throwing more lasers and more microscopes at cells and molecules !). I now joined Ricardo’s lab and I want to exploit my microscopy skills to study more complex biological systems with my microscopy skills (throwing some cells at my microscope!).</p>

<p> <b>Reason(s) that made me get into science?</b>

The idea (and ideal) of discovery!</p>

<p><b>Where do I see myself in 5 years?</b>

Head of my own lab, working on fast 3D microscopy to understand viral replication at cellular and sub-cellular levels.</p>

<p><b>Any hobbies?</b>

Capoeira and cooking ! (a well-balanced system of input and output of calories). </p>
