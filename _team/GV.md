<p align= "justify">
Giuseppe Vicidomini studied computer science at the Department of Computer and Information Science, University of Genoa (DISI, Genoa, Italy) and received his Diploma in 2003. From 2003 to 2007 he worked at the Laboratory of Advance Microscopy and Spectroscopy (LAMBS, University of Genoa, Genoa, Italy); where he received his Ph.D (advised by Prof. Alberto Diaspro) about image processing and analysis for fluorescence microscopy. From 2008 to 2011 he worked as a post-doctoral fellow at the Department of NonoBiophotonics, Max Planck Institute for Biophysical Chemistry (MPI, Goettingen, Germany); where he developed a new approach to further enhance the resolution ability of stimulated emission deletion (STED) microscopy. Since May 2011 he works in the Department of NanoPhysics, Italian Institute of Technology (IIT, Genoa, Italy), where in September 2013 he obtained a Researcher position and in May 2016 he became principal investigator of the Molecular Microscopy and Spectroscopy research line. His research interests are primarily concentrated on theoretical design, development and validation of novel optical and analytical tools that allow the modern biologists to peer inside living biological systems with unprecedented temporal/spatial abilities and massive information content.
