### Our Goal
<body align="justify">
Because of their non-invasive effect on living systems, light microscopy and spectroscopy have been the workhorses for studies of structures and functions at the cellular, sub-cellular and molecular levels for almost a century.
However, many challenging questions of molecular and cellular biology remain beyond their conventional capabilities. The temporal and spatial resolutions, the labeling and contrast methods of conventional microscopy and spectroscopy pose fundamental limits for investigating the smallest and fastest puzzling mysteries of life. Furthermore the information content potentially provides by the experiemnts is not fully decoded.
The core research of our group is the design, development and validation of novel optical and analytical tools that allow the modern biologists to peer inside living cells and organisms with unprecedented temporal-spatial resolutions, minimal invasivity, and augmented information content.
This goal can be achieved only working across many disciplines, from physics to engineering, from computer science to biology. Our projects want to synergicaly integrate novel contrast imaging mechanisms, labeling probes, optical architectures and computational approaches that can be readily adopted by IIT's biologists and researchers all over the world.

### The Laboratory
We're based at the Center for Human Technology at the [Italian Institute of Technology](https://iit.it).
