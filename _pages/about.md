Welcome to my personal web page. I'm a postdoctoral researcher in the <a href="https://www.iit.it/research/lines/molecular-microscopy-and-spectroscopy">Molecular Microscopy and Spectroscopy group</a> of <a href="https://www.iit.it/people/giuseppe-vicidomini">Dr. Giuseppe Vicidomini</a> at the Italian Institute of Technology in Genoa, Italy. My research interests include the theoretical design and experimental validation of optical microscopy and spectroscopy tools such as multiphoton image scanning microscopy and fluorescence correlation spectroscopy.
