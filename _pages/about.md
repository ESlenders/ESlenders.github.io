Welcome to my personal web page. I'm a Marie Skłodowska-Curie Actions research fellow in the <a href="https://www.iit.it/research/lines/molecular-microscopy-and-spectroscopy">Molecular Microscopy and Spectroscopy group</a> of <a href="https://www.iit.it/people/giuseppe-vicidomini">Dr. Giuseppe Vicidomini</a> at the Italian Institute of Technology in Genoa, Italy. My research interests include the theoretical design and experimental validation of optical microscopy and spectroscopy tools such as multiphoton image scanning microscopy, fluorescence correlation spectroscopy, and super-resolution microscopy through single-molecule localization.

This project has received funding from the European Union’s Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme under the Marie Skłodowska-Curie grant agreement No 890923 (SM-SPAD).
